The start of a personal project I'm hoping to build up over time. Right now it serves as an isomorphic javascript boilerplate/proof of concept. 

Both the server and client share the same NodeJS codebase using Director for routing and React for view/component rendering. Build and development scripts handled by Gulp and Browserify used to package the code for client.

I've had a blast so far working through building this up. Ask me about it some time.
